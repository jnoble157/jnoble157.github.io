<p>Welcome! My name is Josh Noble. I was born and raised in Pittsburgh PA but left home in 2016 to pursue a BS in Electrical Engineering at RIT. My experiences over the next 5 years shaped my life tremendously and landed me where I am today, working as an engineer in Austin TX. Although I don't have any posts yet, my eventual goal with the blog is to document these life experiences and reflect on the lessons I've learned.</p>
