I"£<p>I'm currently a student at RIT graduating this upcoming Spring. After graduation, I'll be heading to Austin to work full-time at AMD as a Product Engineer. Check out my <a href="/assets/resume_2020.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> to get a better idea of my background and interests.</p>

<p>Outside of work I enjoy skateboarding, playing basketball and volleyball, reading, and going on road trips with friends.</p>
